## Best Practices for Contingency Planning

1. **Regular Updates**: Review and update your contingency plan quarterly or after significant organizational changes.

2. **Testing and Exercises**: Conduct regular tabletop exercises and simulations to test the effectiveness of your plan.

3. **Documentation**: Keep detailed documentation of all systems, processes, and dependencies.

4. **Cross-Training**: Ensure multiple team members understand critical roles and responsibilities.

5. **Communication Planning**: Develop clear communication protocols for emergencies.

6. **Vendor Management**: Include contingency plans for critical vendor disruptions.

7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure your plan meets industry and regulatory requirements.

## FIPS 199 Security Categorization Guide

The FIPS 199 standard helps organizations categorize information systems based on the potential impact of a security breach:

- **Low (L)**: Limited adverse effect on operations, assets, or individuals
- **Moderate (M)**: Serious adverse effect on operations, assets, or individuals
- **High (H)**: Severe or catastrophic adverse effect on operations, assets, or individuals

Consider these impacts across three security objectives:
- **Confidentiality**: Preventing unauthorized disclosure of information
- **Integrity**: Preventing improper modification or destruction of information
- **Availability**: Ensuring timely and reliable access to information
